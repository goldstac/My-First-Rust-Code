# 🦀 My First & Last Rust Project

## Welcome to my one and only Rust creation.
### I tried Rust for approximately 3 minutes and realized…

## The borrow checker is stronger than me 😭

So I ran back to C like:

```bash
gcc main.c -o never_leaving_c
```

💔 Why I Quit Rust

## Ownership? I don’t even own a house.

## Borrowing? I already owe too many loans.

## Lifetimes? I’m still figuring out my own.

## 📝 The Code
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("I Like C");
}
```

## Yes. That’s it. That’s the whole career.

# 🏁 The End

## Replaced by C.
## Rust was fun for 3 minutes.
## Hello, world! …and goodbye, Rust.
##  This repo is now a memorial. 🦀
